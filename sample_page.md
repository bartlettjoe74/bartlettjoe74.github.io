## Calculator Project

**Project description:** I created a calculator from scratch that performs the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It is fully functioning in the exact same way any calculator with these four functions can operate. It is very easy to use and its UI is straightforward. <br>

This was a course project for CSC 3220 Applications Programming, which I took in the Spring of 2019. My instructor was Dr. Taiwoo Park.
I was the main programmer for this project. To make the project, I used QT and programmed in C++.
